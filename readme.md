# Draw on a map, generate GeoJSON, write to Gist

This repo demonstrates a simple-page that enables:

1. a non-technical user to easily annotate a map - using simple drawing tools.  
  
2. a non-technical user to save and share their map annotation, in the form of `GeoJSON`, without knowing what the hell `GeoJSON` actually is.

The repo uses:

* `Mapbox GL JS` for the base map,  

* `Mapbox GL Draw` to facilitate drawing on the map, and generating the underlying `GeoJSON`

* `Github Gist` for saving and sharing the `GeoJSON` document. 

* `Bootstrap 3` for the layout 

* and a wee bit of `Jquery` (yuck)



# Demo

Ever wanted to see a map of the [Parliamentary Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Triangle,_Canberra) of Canberra, Australia?  Of course you have.  Let me draw that for you.
